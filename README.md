<div style="text-align:center">
  LeagueToolkit is an application made for extracting, reading, modifying and sending back data from the updated League of Legends client. This includes data like a player's level, rank, wins and losses and a bunch more stuff, which can be changed with this app.
</div>

If you want to know more about this process and how it works exactly, please check out [this post on the Riot Games Engineering Blog](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/architecture-league-client-update)!

## The Reason Behind It

Goal of this application is to show the process of how the LCU handles a player's data and how it is possible to interfere this process.

## Design

![Preview](https://github.com/4dams/LeagueToolkit/blob/master/LeagueToolkit/images/previews/1.png)

For the design of the app, we wanted to stick to the clean and flawless design of the LCU, as you can see on the [preview page](https://github.com/4dams/LeagueToolkit/wiki/Previews) of this repository or simply in the app itself.
